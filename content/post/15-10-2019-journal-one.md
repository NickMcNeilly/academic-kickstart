There was a lot of uncertainty in my readings for this week. I thought the  'Ghosts in the Machine' article was fascinating and well thought-out, in addition to self-reflective. Most of my concerns stemmed from Bethany Nowviskie's article on 'Spectra for Speculative Knowledge Design', which seemed to advocate for the creation of 'imagined' documents that would express what we believe, or even just wish, would exhibit stories of the past and present that were suppressed, lost, or damaged. It's a topic I'll definitely have to warm up to, to say the least.
