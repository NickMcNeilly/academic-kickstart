## Code
### October 15, 2019

- It was expensive to get started with code. The devices needed to do code had a high entry cost.
- Originally, games were seen as a source of good: computing was seen as a transformative experience. After Columbine, they were seen in a much more negative light.
- These days, teaching coding is seen as a corporate moneypot. These skills are considered highly valuable for capitalistic moneymaking at low cost.
