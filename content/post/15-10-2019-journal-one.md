## Code
### October 15, 2019

- It was expensive to get started with code. The devices needed to do code had a high entry cost
- Originally, games were seen as a source of good: computing was seen as a transformative experience. After Columbine, they were seen in a much more negative light
- These days, teaching coding is seen as a corporate moneypot. These skills are considered highly valuable for capitalistic moneymaking at low cost
- There's pushback to DH. Some see it as a neoliberalization of the University, others see it as a 'dumbing down' of the Humanities
- Prof. Graham foudn access to archaeological resources online that would have been impossible to access traditionally
- Netlogo simulations
- It's not just about the code, it's about what the code can do
- 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 <--- Code Example, break it down
- Like languages generally, there are contextual fossils within code - the 'Print' command, now associated with displaying text on a screen, was once used to literally print from teletype machines
