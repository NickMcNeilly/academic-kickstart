## Code
### October 15, 2019

- It was expensive to get started with code. The devices needed to do code had a high entry cost
- Originally, games were seen as a source of good: computing was seen as a transformative experience. After Columbine, they were seen in a much more negative light
- These days, teaching coding is seen as a corporate moneypot. These skills are considered highly valuable for capitalistic moneymaking at low cost
- There's pushback to DH. Some see it as a neoliberalization of the University, others see it as a 'dumbing down' of the Humanities
- Prof. Graham foudn access to archaeological resources online that would have been impossible to access traditionally
- Netlogo simulations
- It's not just about the code, it's about what the code can do
- 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 <--- Code Example, break it down
- Like languages generally, there are contextual fossils within code - the 'Print' command, now associated with displaying text on a screen, was once used to literally print from teletype machines
- This character map (CHR$) draws us into the history of typing and mechanical reproduction of text, whilst the entire language draws us into the social history of how people interact with computers
- For a long time, the computer wasn't a machine - it was a person
- There is some mapping between how we use the worlds and how computers interpret those words. To get from 'make an infinite maze for me' to pulses of electrical energy, there must be some layer of translation and interpretation
- Programming is an act of forgetting. The side-effect of 'it just works' is everything that's been forgotten
