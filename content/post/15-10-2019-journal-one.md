There was a lot of uncertainty in my readings for this week. I thought the  'Ghosts in the Machine' article was fascinating and well thought-out, in addition to self-reflective. Most of my concerns stemmed from Bethany Nowviskie's article on 'Spectra for Speculative Knowledge Design', which seemed to advocate for the creation of 'imagined' documents that would express what we believe, or even just wish, would exhibit stories of the past and present that were suppressed, lost, or damaged. It's a topic I'll definitely have to warm up to, to say the least.

# Digital Storytelling

This week's readings were super relevant to my interests. I'm an avid writer and gamer both, and the subject of storytelling in digital mediums would probably be the topic of my research paper if I wasn't taking the coursework stream. There's some disturbing stuff in these readings, too - particularly in relation to Gamergate, the history of which is a 'story' in its own way - but the rest was encouraging.Natalia Martinsson's presentation was especially useful.

# Sound

This was a fun one, since it gave me a lot of inspiration for my February 'Computational Creativity' presentation. In the interests of preventing overlap, I'll try to focus on the subject of sound itself. Sound has always seemed to be somewhat underrepresented in humanities work, but (in my limited experience) it seems to significantly more attention in digital circles. Is this because audio and sound are so closely linked to the digital these days that they become part and parcel of DH merely by association, or is the additional focus more a result of the interdisciplinary nature of DH? Is it neither of these things, and DH scholars simply find audio a useful medium for expressing or investigating their subjects of interest?
