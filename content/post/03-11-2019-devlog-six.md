## Physicality Tests and Uploads

I've implemented template physicality tests to allow players to answer fill-in-the-blank questions pertaining to Ottawa to give them an edge in gameplay, which should help to more thoroughly interweave the locationality of Ottawa with the game itself. Furthermore, I've uploaded the game to a github page that can be found at https://nickmcneilly.github.io/shinersgame/ - though it's not kept up-to-date with the devlogs, it allows a testing zone to experiment with an early build of the game.

With all the base gameplay out of the way, any further work I make on the game can be sorted into two general categories: narrative and multimedia. Narrative work means adding new choices and new story hooks. I plan to have three acts total. Act one focuses on the building of the canal, where the player has a steady income. The second act takes place after the canal is finished, and without steady work the player will be forced to make some hard choices - this is where the Shiners start to come into play. Finally, the third act will take place during the height of Aylen's reign where the Shiners are in full swing. I'm currently approaching the end of Act 1 development.

Multimedia work involves audio and images. This is rather low on my priorities list, at the moment, but if I find the time to work on them they could really help involve the player immerse themselves into the game experience.
