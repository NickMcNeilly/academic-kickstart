## Finale

The game is done. Well, the first pass, at least - it still needs to be playtested. There are currently three acts to progress through: Act 1 for the Rideau Canal construction phase, Act 2 for when the player is out of work and lacks a reliable source of income, and Act 3 is when the Bytown Shiners come into fruition as a gang - which the player may or may not align themselves with. Now it's just a matter of playtesting and getting a few more eyes on the project. I'm too close to the project deadline to make any broad, sweeping changes - but tweaks are still very much possible.
