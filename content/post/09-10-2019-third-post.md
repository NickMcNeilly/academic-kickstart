## Preceding Thoughts

Before I start working on the game in earnest, there are a few things I've needed to consider relating to how the game will function both mechanically and thematically. I also have to consider the societal implications of my work. Do I think the conditions of Irish immigrants in the 19th century is a controversial, hot-button issue? No. But I do think a lot of the questions I intend to address _are_ - such as race, class, immigration, revolution, and violence. I don’t intend to make a didactic experience that beats its participants over the head with any overt message, and while I don’t intend to condone the Shiner’s historical actions I do think that the experience is going to be at least sympathetic towards them.
